## Shout-outs

This Launchbar action is inspired by the wonderfully-handy [emoji.muan.co](http://emoji.muan.co). :raised_hands:

The emoji keywords are brought to you by the fantastic resource that is [muan/emojilib](https://github.com/muan/emojilib). :books:

If Launchbar isn't your thing, be sure to check out [muan/mojibar](https://github.com/muan/mojibar) or [carlosgaldino/alfred-emoji-workflow](https://github.com/carlosgaldino/alfred-emoji-workflow). :tophat:

## What about Launchbar's built-in emoji action?

Launchbar's [built-in emoji action][] is great when you already know the name of the emoji you're looking for. :dart:

Sometimes you don't know the exact name, but you know a keyword or synonym. With this action, whether you know the exact name or you only know a keyword, you can quickly track down the emoji you want. :ok_hand:
